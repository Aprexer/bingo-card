*   **Easy Marking System:** Tap the dedicated circle in the corner of each square to mark it as complete.
*   **Item Database:** Add a list of potential bingo items in a dedicated, collapsible section.
*   **Random Population:** Automatically fill the entire bingo card with a random selection of items from your database with a single click.
*   **Save & Load Progress:** All your text, marked squares, and database items are automatically saved in your browser's local storage.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** The layout is optimized for mobile devices, with a locked scale to prevent accidental zooming and provide a native app feel.
*   **Collapsible UI:** The item database can be hidden when not in use to save screen space.
*   **Downloadable & Portable:** Save the current state of your bingo card (including text and markings) as a self-contained, static HTML file to share or archive.
